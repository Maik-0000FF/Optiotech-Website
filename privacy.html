                free of charge at any time. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you
                have given consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the
                right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore,
                you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.

            <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
            <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
            <p>
                We host our website on GitHub Pages. The provider is GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.
            </p>
            <p>
                GitHub automatically collects information in so-called log files that your browser transmits. These are:

            <p>
                This data is not merged with other data sources. The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their
                website - for this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.

            <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>
                The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data
                confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally
                identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for
                what purpose this is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have
                security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Note on the Responsible Party</h3>
            <p>
                The responsible party for data processing on this website is:
            </p>
            <p>
                Maik Bludovsky<br>
                Hansaplatz 4<br>
                20099 Hamburg<br>
                Germany<br>
                Email: <a href="mailto:optiotech@web.de">optiotech@web.de</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and
                means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
            </p>

            <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
            <p>
                Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
                with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or
                revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons
                for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will
                take place after these reasons no longer apply.
            </p>

            <h3>Note on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</h3>
            <p>
                We use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not safe under data protection law.
                When these tools are active, your personal data can be transferred to these third countries and processed there.
                We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries.
            </p>

            <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already
                given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
            </p>

            <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>
                IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
                YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
                BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
                IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE
                GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION,
                EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
            </p>

            <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>
                In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,
                in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement.
                The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
            </p>

            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
                contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
                transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.
            </p>

            <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you
                send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
                the browser's address line changing from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
            </p>
            <p>
                If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>Information, Deletion and Correction</h3>
            <p>
                Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored
                personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction
                or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice if you
                have further questions on the subject of personal data.
            </p>

            <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time
                at the address given in the legal notice. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
                    duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of
                    data processing instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have
                    the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests
                    and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
                    restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li>

            <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

            <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
            <p>
                The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your
                browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                <li>Operating system used</li>
                <li>Referrer URL</li>
                <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>Time of the server request</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This data is not merged with other data sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest
                in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their website - for this purpose, the server log files
                must be recorded.
            </p>

            <h3>Contact Form / Email Contact</h3>
            <p>
                If you send us inquiries via email, your data from the inquiry including the contact data you provided there will
                be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on
                this data without your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment
                of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing
                is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)
                or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent
                to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been processed).
                Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.
            </p>

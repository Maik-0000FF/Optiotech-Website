            <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
            <p>
                As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 Para. 1 TMG.
                However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
                circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard
                is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will
                remove this content immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
            <p>
                Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
                liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
                linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable
                at the time of linking.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement.
                Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>Copyright</h2>
